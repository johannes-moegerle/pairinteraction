    r"""Get the perturbative Hamiltonian at a desired order in Rayleigh-Schr√∂dinger perturbation theory.

    This function takes a list of tuples of ket states, which forms the basis of the model space in which the effective
    Hamiltonian is calculated. The whole Hamiltonian is taken from a pair system.
    The Hamiltonian of the pair system is assumed to be diagonal in the unperturbed Hamiltonian, all off-diagonal
    elements are assumed to belong to the perturbative term.
    The function also checks for resonances between all states and states in the model space.

    Args:
        ket_tuple_list: List of all pair states that span up the model space.
            The effective Hamiltonian is calculated for these states.
        system_pair: Two-Atom-System, diagonal in the basis of the unperturbed Hamiltonian.
        order: Order up to which the perturbation theory is expanded. Support up to third order.
            Default is second order.
        required_overlap: If set, the code checks for validity of a perturbative treatment.
            Error is thrown if the perturbed eigenstate has less overlap than this value with the
            unperturbed eigenstate.
        unit: The unit to which to convert the result. Default None will return a pint quantity.

          a sparse matrix in compressed row format. Each row represents the corresponding eigenvector.
